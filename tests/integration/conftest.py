"""Integration fixtures: a real ``create_app`` in theme mode with the subscription stack.

Boot: email, cms, checkout, subscription, discount (the REAL domain plugins and their
public API), theme, theme_cms, theme_checkout, theme_subscription; fe-user
"cms", "checkout" and "subscription" enabled. Data lives in the shared
``*_test`` database, each test in a rolled-back transaction; plans, payment
methods and CMS pages are seeded through the admin HTTP APIs.
